# ngImageService
An angular style image service, which resizes images and returns file dataURLs by exposing an API which returns promises, which then are resolved with whatever has been calculated.

This is just a quick script I wrote based on all kinds of stackoverflow answers and what not. If you think I've accidentally lifted something off of you enough for it to guarantee your mention, please contact me. Otherwise, use it as you see fit. (within the constraints of MIT license).

If you found a bug, or thought of something interesting to add, use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/ReinisV/ngImageService/issues) or create a [Pull request](https://github.com/ReinisV/ngImageService/pulls).

**TODO:**

create a plnkr to explain it's usage
make an API interface function which takes in a DataURL as a parameter for resizing.
